# USWNT Performance at the Women's World Cup 2023 Analysis
The US Women's National Team (USWNT) was eliminated in the 2023 Women's World Cup in the Round of 16 which was their earliest exit ever. This analysis takes a look at why the US team underperformed this year, compares their performance to when they won it all in 2019, and looks at whether the team should be worried for the future.
